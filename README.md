# Insecure SSH Server Container

This is an insecure SSH container image.  It runs SSH on port 3456/TCP with a username and password embedded in the Dockerfile

DO NOT USE THIS in a production environment, unless you like being compromised.

If you want a container with a randomly generated SSH password look [here](https://github.com/raesene/alpine-containertools)
